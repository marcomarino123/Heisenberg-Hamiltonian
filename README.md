Calculation of Magnons, starting from TB2J files or model Heisenberg Hamiltonian (isotropic J) 

... proper commenting missing...

working on a better algorithm for Berry-phase calculation in radtools package ...

(2-....py is not giving proper magnonic bands; it is better to use the downfolding of 3-...py)

for the newest version of the code look at the directory magnons_total_system(/main.cpp)
